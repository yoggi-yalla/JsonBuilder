node is the highest level of abstraction, each node has a type

type can be object, array, or leaf

an object is parent to nodes with names
an array is parent to nodes without names
a leaf can not be parent to further nodes

each node in an object has a name
use name_col to fetch name from column
use name to specify name directly

each leaf has a value (string, float, int, true, false, or none)
use value_col to fetch value from column
use value to specify value directly

sub_items is a list of all child nodes

filter is used to set the scope of the dataframe
group is used to split the scope into groups and build one node for each group
every row of the current scope is a group by default

func is used to apply a lambda function to a node after it has been created
