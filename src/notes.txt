'''
A 'mapping' describes the output JSON as a tree of nodes,
a node can have the following attributes:

type
name
name_col
value
value_col
children
filter
multiple
group_by
func

type must be either 'object', 'array', or 'leaf'

an object is parent to nodes with names
an array is parent to nodes without names
a leaf can not be parent to further nodes

children is a list of all child nodes

each child to an object must have a name
use name_col to fetch name dynamically from a column
use name to set a hard coded name

each leaf has a value (string, float, int, bool, or none)
use value_col to fetch value dynamically from a column
use value to set a hard coded value

filter is used to reduce the scope of the dataframe

('multiple': true) means the current scope should generate multiple nodes
the default behavior is that each row of the scope generates one node,
if group_by is also present then each group of the scope generates one node
group_by should contain a pandas groupby function, e.g. 'df.col_name'

func is used to apply a function to a node after it has been created
