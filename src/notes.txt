'''
A 'mapping' describes the output JSON as a tree of nodes,
a node can have the following attributes:

type
name
name_col
value
value_col
children
filter
multiple
group_by
func

type must be either 'object', 'array', 'primitive', (or 'prim_array')

an object is parent to nodes with names
an array is parent to nodes without names
a primitive can not be parent to further nodes

children is a list of all child nodes

each child to an object must have a name
use name_col to fetch name dynamically from a column
use name to set a hard coded name

each primitive has a value (string, float, int, bool, or none)
use value_col to fetch value dynamically from a column
use value to set a hard coded value

filter is used to reduce the scope of the dataframe

'multiple': false	#(this is the default behaviour)
means the current scope should build one instances of this node

'multiple': true
means the current scope should build several instances of this node
the default behaviour is to build one instance for each row in the scope
if group_by is also present then each group of the scope builds one node

func is used to apply a function to a node after it has been created
