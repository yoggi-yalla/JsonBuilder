'''
A 'mapping' describes the output JSON as a tree of nodes,
a node can have the following attributes:

type
name
name_col
value
value_col
children
filter
group
func

type must be either object, array, or leaf

an object is parent to nodes with a name
an array is parent to nodes without a name
a leaf can not be parent to further nodes

children is a list of all child nodes

each child to an object has a name
use name_col to fetch name from column
use name to set a hard coded name

each leaf has a value (string, float, int, true, false, or none)
use value_col to fetch value from column
use value to set a hard coded value

filter is used to set the scope of the dataframe

group splits the scope into groups and builds one JSON node for each group
if group is set to false each row of the scope becomes a group
the full scope is considered one group by default

func is used to apply a function to a JSON node after it has been created

(filter and func use 'eval' and should be reworked)
